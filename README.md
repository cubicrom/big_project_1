Analytics for planning the advertising budget of the game store

The online store "Streamchik" sells computer games all over the world. 

Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. We need to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. 

This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
